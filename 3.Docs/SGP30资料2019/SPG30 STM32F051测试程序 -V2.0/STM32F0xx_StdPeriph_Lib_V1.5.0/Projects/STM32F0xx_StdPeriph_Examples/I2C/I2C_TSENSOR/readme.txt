@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STLM75 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
STM320518-EVAL board and used to get instantaneous external temperature
(-55°C to +125°C).
 
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easily monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.

The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.

By default the EVAL demo are setting them to (see main.c file):
  
   #define TEMPERATURE_THYS 31
   #define TEMPERATURE_TOS 32

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - STLM75 I2C temperature sensor is already available on this board.
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - STLM75 I2C temperature sensor is already available on this board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval_i2c_tsensor.c
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval_lcd.c 
       
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM32072B_EVAL/stm32072b_eval_i2c_tsensor.c
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM32072B_EVAL/stm32072b_eval.c
