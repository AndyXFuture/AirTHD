@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 7 PWM signals 
with 4 different duty cycles (50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5%).

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz for STM32F0xx devices.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
The channel 1 and channel 1N duty cycle is set to 50%
The channel 2 and channel 2N duty cycle is set to 37.5%
The channel 3 and channel 3N duty cycle is set to 25%
The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5%
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0Discovery and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F0Discovery board Set-up
     - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
        - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)
        - TIM1_CH1N pin (PA.07)
        - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)
        - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.00)
        - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)
        - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.01)
        - TIM1_CH4  pin (PA.11)
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
        - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)
        - TIM1_CH1N pin (PA.07)
        - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)
