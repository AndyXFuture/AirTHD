@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of an 
external signal.

The TIM1 clock frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).

SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz.

TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed. 
The "TIM1Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM1Freq = TIM1 counter clock / Capture in Hz,
where the Capture is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures. 

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1100 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PA.09).
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PA.09).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
