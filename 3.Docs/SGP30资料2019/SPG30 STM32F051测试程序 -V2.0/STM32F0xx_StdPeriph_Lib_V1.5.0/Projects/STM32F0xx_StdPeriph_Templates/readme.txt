@par Project Example Template Description 

This example is used as a template project that can be used as reference to build
any new firmware application for STM32F0xx devices using the STM32F0xx Standard
Peripherals Library.

@par Directory contents 

This folder contains standard template projects for EWARM, MDK-ARM and Truestudio
toolchains that compile the needed STM32F0xx Standard Peripheral's drivers plus all the 
user-modifiable files that are necessary to create a new project.

  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f0xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f0xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers 
  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f0xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/main.c              Main program  
  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/main.h              Header for main.c module
  - Project/STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates/system_stm32f0xx.c  STM32F0xx system source file

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F0xx_Clock_Configuration_VX.Y.Z.xls" 
      provided with the AN4055 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
