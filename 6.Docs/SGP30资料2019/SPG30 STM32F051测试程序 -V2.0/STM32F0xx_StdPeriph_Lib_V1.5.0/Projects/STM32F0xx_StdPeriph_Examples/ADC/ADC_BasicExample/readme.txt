@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to convert continuously the voltage 
applied to the EVAL Board potentiometer input. 
The converted voltage is displayed on the EVAL Board LCD.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval_lcd.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
