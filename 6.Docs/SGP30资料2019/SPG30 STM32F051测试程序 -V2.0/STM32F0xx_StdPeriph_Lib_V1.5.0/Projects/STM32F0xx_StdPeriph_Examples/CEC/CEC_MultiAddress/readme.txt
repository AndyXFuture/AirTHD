@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic communication between two HDMI-CEC devices using 
interrupts, which the follower one supports two addresses at the same time. 
The first CEC device send a command to the CEC other device. 
The data received by the first and second CEC device are stored respectively in 
ReceiveBuffer. In both boards, the data transfers is managed using CEC_IRQHandler
in stm32F0xx_it.c file.

The example illustrates the use of the CEC communication between two devices. 
A device configured as transmitter can send a frame to the other device by pressing
the Joystick button(Right,Left) on the EVAL board. The receiver device supports
two addresses(0x03=>Tuner, 0x05=>Audio system).

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two two boards (STM320518-EVAL or STM32072B-EVAL)
(let's call them Device_1 and Device_2) then connect these two boards through CEC lines
(PB10 for STM320518-EVAL and PB08 for STM32072B-EVAL  or HDMI connectors) and GND.
In the firmware example, uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file  to use
the CEC peripheral as STM32 device_1 or as STM32 device_2.

- Software Description

At each joystick buttons press:
- The CEC Transmitter device sends a command to the specific receiver device.
  - If Joystick RIGHT is pressed: send a CEC message to the Tuner device(0x03),
  - If Joystick LEFT is pressed: send a CEC message to the Audio system device(0x05).
  
- At the end of the header reception, the own address is compared with the received
  destination address. In the case of matching address with 
  - Tuner        => The message is received and Green Led is on,
  - Audio system => The message is received and Blue Led is on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     Connect the boards by using one of the two following alternatives:
      - A HDMI Cables between all boards HDMI-CEC connectors (CN3 or CN4) on 
        STM320518-EVAL . 
      - Use a simple wire between all devices CEC Lines (PB.10), in this case don't 
        forget to connect all boards grounds together.
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     Connect the boards by using one of the two following alternatives:
      - A HDMI Cables between all boards HDMI-CEC connectors (CN3 or CN5) on 
        STM32072B-EVAL . 
      - Use a simple wire between all devices CEC Lines (PB.08), in this case don't 
        forget to connect all boards grounds together.
