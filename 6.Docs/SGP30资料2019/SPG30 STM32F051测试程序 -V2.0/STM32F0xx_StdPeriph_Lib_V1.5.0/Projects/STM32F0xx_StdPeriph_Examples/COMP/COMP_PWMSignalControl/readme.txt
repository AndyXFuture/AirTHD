@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure COMP2 peripheral to hold on safe state
(low level) TIM1 channels as soon as COMP2 output is set at high level.

  - COMP2 is configured as following:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
     - Non Inverting input is connected to PA3
     - Output is internally connected to TIM2 BKIN (Break Input)

  - TIM1CLK is set to 48 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM1 counter
    clock used is 48 MHz.
    TIM1 frequency is defined as follow:
    TIM1 channels frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (Period + 1) 
                            = 48000000 /(100 + 1) 
                            = 475 KHz.

  - External voltage should be connected to PA3 (RV3 potentiometer can be used).

  - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM1 channel PA8 to display waveform. 

  - While PA3 is lower than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PA8.
    While PA3 is higher than VREFINT, PA8 is in low level.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - RV3 Potentiometer connected to PC.01 pin.
    - Connect PA.03 to PC.01 pin using a wire.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display waveform.
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - RV3 Potentiometer connected to PC.00 pin.
    - Connect PA.03 to PC.00 pin using a wire.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display waveform.
