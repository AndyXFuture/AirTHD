@par  Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to WFI mode and wake-up from this mode 
using External interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 48 MHz. When the user presses
on the Key push button, the MCU enters in WFI mode. If the user presses again on the
Key push button, LED3 is toggled with a frequency depending on the system clock, this
is used to indicate whether the MCU is in WFI or RUN mode. 

Pressing Tamper push button (generates rising edge on EXTI Line13) will put the core
in the WFI mode, causing the LED3 to stop toggling.
To wake-up from WFI mode you have to press again on the button which generates an
interrupt which exits the system from WFI mode. Then LED3 restarts toggling.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the Tamper push-button 
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use the Tamper push-button 



@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select STM32F051 workspace 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
