@par Example Description 

This example describes how to configure the TIM to trigger the ADC conversion.

In this example the TIM1 is configured in PWM mode, the TIM1 CC4 event is used
to trigger the ADC.

The ADC is configured to convert continuously the ADC_Channel_11 (connected to
potentiometer RV3 on the STM320518-EVAL Board) or ADC_Channel_10 (connected to
potentiometer RV3 on the STM32072B-EVAL Board).
Each time the TIM1 CC4 event occurs, the ADC convert the variable voltage. 
 
User can display continuously the ADC_Channel_11 or ADC_Channel_10 voltage on 
the EVAL Board LCD

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

 - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the potentiometer RV3 to change the ADC_Channel_11 voltage.
    
 - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the potentiometer RV3 to change the ADC_Channel_10 voltage.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval_lcd.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_lcd.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
