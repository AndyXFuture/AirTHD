@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to interface with a encoder sensor.
The TIM3 is configured in encoder mode1: Counter counts up/down on TI2 rising edge 
depending on TI1 level 

The TIM3 Autoreload value is set to 399, so the encoder round is 400 TIM counter clock. 
An update interrupt is generated each time the TIM counter reach the Autoreload value, 
in this example 400 TIM counter clock.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select the appropriate workspace 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
