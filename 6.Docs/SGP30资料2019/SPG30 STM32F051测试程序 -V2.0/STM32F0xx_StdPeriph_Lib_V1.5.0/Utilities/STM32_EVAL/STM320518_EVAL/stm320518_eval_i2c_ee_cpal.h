---------------------------------
   How To use the EEPROM Driver:
---------------------------------
----- All EEPROM operations are controlled and monitored through a single
      structure. This structure holds all necessary parameters to manage EEPROM
      communication (pointer to CPAL I2C device structure, EEPROM address, 
      EEPROM page size, EEPROM memory addressing mode, EEPROM state).
         
----- User should follow these steps to use this driver correctly :

      -1-  STRUCTURE INITIALIZATION 
      Start by initializing the structure holding EEPROM Information. To perform 
      this action, the global variable sEEx_DevStructure declared in EEPROM driver 
      as sEE_InitTypeDef (sEE1_DevStructure for EEPROM connected with I2C1, 
      sEE2_DevStructure for EEPROM connected with I2C1 ...) must be used.

      sEE_InitTypeDef structure contains five parameters:

           *- CPAL_InitTypeDef* sEE_CPALStructure : Pointer on a CPAL Device structure 
                                                    relative to the device instantiated 
                                                    to communicate with EEPROM.

           *- uint32_t sEEAddress : Contains the EEPROM device Address.
  
           *- uint32_t sEEPageSize : Contains the page size of EEPROM Memory.

           *- uint8_t sEEMemoryAddrMode : Bit-field value specifying Memory Addressing Mode.

           *- __IO sEE_StateTypeDef sEEState : Holds the current State of the EEPROM device. 

       To configure this structure, user must initialize only three parameters 
       (sEEAddress, sEEPageSize, sEEMemoryAddrMode).
       
       Example:
         sEE1_DevStructure.sEEAddress = 0xA0; // set EEPROM address to 0xA0 
         sEE1_DevStructure.sEEPageSize = 32;  // set page size to 32
         sEE1_DevStructure.sEEMemoryAddrMode = sEE_OPT_16BIT_REG; // enable 16Bit memory addressing mode
                           
      -2- DEVICE CONFIGURATION 
      Call the function sEE_StructInit() to initialize I2Cx CPAL device structure 
      relative to EEPROM than call sEE_Init() to configure the selected device
      with the selected configuration.
      
      -3- READ / WRITE OPERATIONS 
      Call the function sEE_WriteBuffer() or sEE_ReadBuffer() to perform transfer operations. 
      These functions start data transfer and exit. sEE_WriteHandler() and sEE_ReadHandler()
      handle the remainder of the communication. sEE_WriteHandler() must be called in 
      CPAL_I2C_TXTC_UserCallback() and sEE_ReadHandler() must be called in CPAL_I2C_RXTC_UserCallback().
      These two callbacks are implemented in "cpal_usercallback.c" file.      
           
      Example of how to implement sEE_WriteHandler() in CPAL_I2C_TXTC_UserCallback():
      
            1** Comment "#define CPAL_I2C_TXTC_UserCallback   (void)" in cpal_conf.h.
            2** Implement CPAL_I2C_TXTC_UserCallback in "cpal_usercallback.c" file.
               
               void CPAL_I2C_TXTC_UserCallback(CPAL_InitTypeDef* pDevInitStruct)
               {
                 sEE_WriteHandler(pDevInitStruct->CPAL_Dev);
               }
      
      User should monitor transfer by testing the value of sEEState parameter of
      sEEx_DevStructure. When transfer is ongoing sEEState is equal to sEE_STATE_WRITING
      or sEE_STATE_READING. After transfer complete this parameter is set to sEE_STATE_IDLE.
      
      Example of how to wait until EEPROM communication finishes:
            
            while(sEE_GetEepromState(&sEE_DevStructure) != sEE_STATE_IDLE)
              {
                //Application may perform other tasks while transfer operation is ongoing 
              }
      
      -4- DEVICE DEINITIALIZATION 
      When transfer operations are finished, you may call sEE_DeInit() to disable I2Cx device 
      and related resources (GPIO, DMA , IT and NVIC) relative to used EEPROM.
